# Blockchange

**Blockchange** is a technical consultancy and knowledge base focused on **multi-rail payment architecture** for global businesses.

The project explores how to design resilient payment systems that route transactions across **cards, bank transfers, local payment rails, and peer-to-peer networks**, with the goal of reducing false declines, avoiding single-provider dependency, and achieving predictable settlement.

## What this repository is about

This repository contains tools, notes, and experiments related to:
- payment architecture design
- cross-border payment routing
- multi-rail in- and off-ramps
- chargeback-free and final-settlement payment flows
- operational risk in international payments

It complements the public documentation and long-form analysis published on the Blockchange website.

## Documentation & Architecture Notes

A detailed breakdown of **multi-rail payment architecture**, including real-world failure modes and routing strategies, is available here:

## Why multi-rail matters

Most payment systems fail internationally not because of APIs, but because of architecture:
- high cross-border card decline rates
- processor account shutdowns
- settlement delays
- hidden single points of failure

Blockchange focuses on **architecture first**, not providers.

## Scope

This project is intentionally:
- vendor-neutral
- non-affiliate
- focused on architecture, not marketing

It is meant to be useful for:
- founders and CTOs
- payment and risk teams
- fintech and Bitcoin infrastructure builders

Blockchange is an ongoing project.  
Content and tools evolve as real-world payment systems evolve.
