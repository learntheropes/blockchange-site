  - title: The problem
    text: >
      In-ramp failures are often caused by fraud systems,
      issuer behavior, geography, and provider policy changes.
      Single-rail setups amplify these failures.

  - title: Multi-rail in-ramp design
    text: >
      We design systems that route payments across different
      rails based on amount, geography, cost, and risk.

  - title: Outcome
    text: >
      Higher acceptance rates, lower dependency risk,
      and a payment stack that adapts over time.
