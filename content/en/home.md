heroHeadline: Multi-Rail In- & Off-Ramp Architecture
heroSubheadline: >
  We design complete value flows — from how money enters your system
  to how it exits — across cards, banks, Pix-style rails,
  stablecoins, and P2P Bitcoin.

heroBullets:
  - Accept payments reliably across borders and risk profiles
  - Design robust payout and settlement strategies
  - Avoid dependency on a single processor or bank

paymentsTitle: Payments accepted today
paymentsItems:
  - Bitcoin (Lightning & on-chain)
  - USDT
  - Credit/debit cards (coming soon)

explanationTitle: What “multi-rail in- & off-ramp” means
explanationText: >
  Most businesses rely on a single payment processor or bank.
  This creates hidden risk: false declines, frozen funds,
  sudden policy changes, and payout bottlenecks.

  A multi-rail in- & off-ramp architecture treats payments as a system,
  not a single integration. Different rails are used depending on
  geography, amount, risk, and operational constraints — both
  when money comes in and when it needs to go out.
